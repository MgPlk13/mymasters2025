## 🧠 AI Support

AI uses a pretrained classification model to detect risky query patterns. It can block queries based on rules or model predictions (e.g. high-risk scores).

## 🗃️ Database

Due to GitHub's 100 MB file size limit, the database is hosted externally.

📥 **Download the full analytics database here:**
[**Google Drive: employees_db-full-1.0.6.db**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gb32Wth6EbQ-cClpUriTgd3GvCZenF4d/view?usp=drive_link)

> After downloading, place the `.db` file in the project root folder (same level as `app.py`).

## 🧪 Running the App

1. Make sure PostgreSQL is running on your machine.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run the app using:

```bash
python app.py
